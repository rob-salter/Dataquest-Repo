    "# Guided Project: Clean And Analyze Employee Exit Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?\n",
    "\n",
    "They want us to combine the results for both surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. In the guided steps, we'll aim to do most of the data cleaning and get you started analyzing the first question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the dete_survey.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- SeparationType: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- Cease Date: The year or month the person's employment ended\n",
    "- DETE Start Date: The year the person began employment with the DETE\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a preview of a couple columns we'll work with from the tafe_survey.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Record ID: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "- Reason for ceasing employment: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
    "- LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years): The length of the person's employment (in years)\n",

    "    \n",
    "  - Explored the data and figured out how to prepare it for analysis\n",
    "  - Corrected some of the missing value\n",
    "  - Dropped any data not needed for our analysis\n",
    "  - Renamed our column\n",
    "  - Verified the quality of our data\n",
    "  - Created a new institute_service colum\n",
